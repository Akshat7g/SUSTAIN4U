            <h5> "Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present, without compromising the
                ability of future generations to meet their own needs."</h5>
            The concept of sustainable development can be interpreted in many different ways, but at its core is an
            approach to development that looks to balance different, and often competing, needs against an awareness of
            the environmental, social and economic limitations we face as a society.While the modern concept of
            sustainable development is derived mostly from the 1987 Brundtland Report, it is also rooted in earlier
            ideas about sustainable forest management and 20th-century environmental concerns.

                <p>
                    Our main aim is to work for umder privileged sections of the society and provide them with a
                    platform where they can share
                    their
                    ideas and we can
                    implement those and work towards achieving sustainable devlopment. UNESCO defines 17 sustainable
                    goals and as of now ,
                    we primarily
                    focus on gender equality. The basic idea is that small scale innovators can get the credits they
                    deserve for their innovations as well as we are able to use their innovations in an effective manner
                    and globally at a larger scale which would significantly help us to take a step forward towards
                    sustainable development.

            </div>
            <p>
                The annual Sustainable Development Goals Report provides an overview of the world’s implementation
                efforts to date, highlighting areas of progress and areas where more action needs to be taken to ensure
                no one is left behind.

                Five years since the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals, the 2020 Report notes that progress
                had been made in some areas, such as improving maternal and child health, expanding access to
                electricity and increasing women’s representation in government. Yet even these advances were offset
                elsewhere by growing food insecurity, deterioration of the natural environment, and persistent and
                pervasive inequalities.

                Now, in only a short period of time, the COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed an unprecedented crisis,
                causing further disruption to SDG progress, with the world’s poorest and most vulnerable affected the
                most.

                Using the latest data and estimates, this annual stocktaking report on progress across the 17 Goals
                shows that it is the poorest and most vulnerable – including children, older persons, persons with
                disabilities, migrants and refugees – who are being hit the hardest by the effects of the COVID-19
                pandemic. Women are also bearing the heaviest brunt of the pandemic’s effects.

                <h5>HOW IS GENDER EQALITY RELATED TO SUSTAINABLE DEVLOPMENT?</h5>
            </div>
            The issue of gender equality has been in the light for quite a lot of time now, but still the dominance
            of men over women is persistent in many parts of the nation. This is mainly due to their mindset and
            forces us to question their upbringing. To eradicate this issue , we need to target the youth of these
            areas and educate them morally which would develop a mindset of equality amongst them. Also , we can
            spread awareness about organisations like Bank Of America who promote women employs , which would
            ultimately encourage them to provide proper education to girls as well and allow them to have a
            professional life.Gender equality is one of the goals laid down by UNESCO for sustainable development ,
            and it is indeed the hardest one to tackle because besides investing time and effort , we have to build
            the personality of an entire generation in such a way that they do not feel a sense of dominance based
            on gender and thereby make the world a better place for themselves as well as their co-existing human
            beings.
